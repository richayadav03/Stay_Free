We have implemented a one-to-one video conferencing tool using WebRTC technology. To make the functionality as an individual project file we uploaded that project in other github repository & deploy from that repo so that we can have an individual link in order to give to our user & therapist.

Link of that repository:

https://github.com/Aneri11U/Online_Video_Conferencing

url after deploying for video chat application:

  https://aneri11u.github.io/Online_Video_Conferencing/index.html?room=45

  here this room id will be separately decided for the end user and therapist and will be updated in the database to have the record of each session.

  also, this link for the session will be given to the user and therapist via mail.

  this is only for 2 user in a room application which we actually needed.
